# Javascript-Yahtzee
Here is a Yahtzee game I created using Javascript. 
Using many asbtract classes and classes I created options for points on a scorecard like in the game Yahtzee.
I created a die class which represents the dice used in Yahtzee. Then I made a dice class to track the rolls from the die and a diceroll class to actually roll the dice.
Then I made a catagory class which held a collection of all the values possible to get in Yahtzee, as well as a bunch of the value classes for Ones, Twos, Threes, etc.
Then a scorecard class to keep score for each players.
Then ultimately a game class and driver to control rounds and who wins!
